## Exercise 1 - Lateral Optimal Controller ##

For the lateral control of the vehicle, design a discrete-time infinite horizon LQR controller.

## Exercise 2 - A* Path Planning algorithm ##

In this exercise, we will implement A* path planning algorithm. Now there is another vehicle driving on the track. If the ego vehicle follows the original trajectory (which aligns with the track), it is likely to crash into the other vehicle. In order to perform the overtaking, we need to re-plan the trajectory. In this problem, we will implement A* path planning algorithm.
