## Exercise 1 - LQR Controller ##

Design a discretetime infinite horizon LQR controller for the quadrotor to track the command when there is no motor failure

## Exercise 2 - MRAC ##

Design a MRAC to fly the quadrotor with 50% lost of thrust in one motor. The motor failure happens after 14s in simulation.
